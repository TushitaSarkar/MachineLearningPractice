Below is a summary of the transformations applied:\n\n#\uD83D\uDD0D Null Handling \u0026 Imputation\n- Identified and removed rows with missing \u0060track_name\u0060.\n- Imputed missing \u0060artist_name\u0060, \u0060artist_popularity\u0060, \u0060artist_followers\u0060, and \u0060artist_genres\u0060 using album-level joins (e.g., for albums like *1989*).\n- Replaced remaining nulls with default values:\n  - \u0060\u0027N/A\u0027\u0060 for strings\n  - \u00600\u0060 for numeric fields\n  - \u0060\u0027[]\u0027\u0060 for genre arrays (temporary placeholder)\n\n#\u2728 Standardization\n- Trimmed whitespace from key fields: \u0060track_name\u0060, \u0060artist_name\u0060, \u0060album_name\u0060, \u0060album_type\u0060, \u0060explicit\u0060.\n- Converted \u0060explicit\u0060 values to uppercase (\u0060TRUE\u0060 / \u0060FALSE\u0060).\n- Cleaned \u0060artist_genres\u0060 using regex to remove brackets and quotes.\n\n# \uD83D\uDCC5 Release Date Normalization\n- For year-only dates (e.g., \u00602020\u0060), appended \u0060-06-30\u0060 to estimate mid-year.\n- For year-month formats (e.g., \u00602020-07\u0060), appended \u0060-01\u0060 to complete the date.\n- Converted all dates to \u0060DATE\u0060 format using \u0060STR_TO_DATE()\u0060.\n\n#\u23F1 Duration Conversion\n- Added a new column \u0060track_duration_min\u0060 by converting \u0060track_duration_ms\u0060 to minutes.\n- Dropped the original \u0060track_duration_ms\u0060 column after conversion.\n\n# \uD83C\uDFB5 Genre Enrichment\n- Populated missing \u0060artist_genres\u0060 for well-known artists using manual overrides:\n  - *Taylor Swift*: \u0060country, pop, indie, folk\u0060\n  - *Olivia Rodrigo*: \u0060pop rock, alternative pop, pop punk\u0060\n  - *Billie Eilish*: \u0060alternative pop, electropop, dark pop\u0060\n  - *(...and more for 10\u002B artists)*\n- Remaining empty genres were replaced with \u0060\u0027N/A\u0027\u0060.\n\n#\uD83E\uDDF9 Deduplication\n- Used \u0060ROW_NUMBER()\u0060 over \u0060track_name\u0060, \u0060artist_name\u0060, \u0060album_name\u0060, and \u0060album_release_date\u0060 to identify duplicates.\n- Removed duplicate rows and dropped the helper \u0060row_num\u0060 column.\n\n---\n\nThis SQL workflow ensures the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for exploratory data analysis, genre modeling, and public sharing.
